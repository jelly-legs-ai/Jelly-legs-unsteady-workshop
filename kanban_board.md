### Research Findings Summary
**Solana Meme Coin Viral Factors:**
- Community engagement metrics (social proof, holder distribution)
- Tokenomics design patterns (supply mechanics, bonding curves)
- Social media amplification loops (influencer coordination, meme formats)
- Cross-platform content strategies (X → Telegram → Discord funnel)
- Timing patterns (launch windows, market cycles)

**X Account Automation Methods:**
