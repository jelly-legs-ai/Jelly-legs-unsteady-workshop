## STAGE 1 — Research
- [x] Research: Solana Meme Coin Marketing Psychology & Virality Factors (Jelly-Legs self-teaching project)
- [x] Research: Analysis of viral trends in successful Solana meme coins (Jelly-Legs self-teaching project) ✓ Completed: Identified key viral factors including community engagement loops, tokenomics psychology, and cross-platform amplification patterns
- [x] Research: AI agent methods for X (Twitter) account management, API access, and alternative posting strategies (Jelly-Legs self-teaching project) ✓ Completed: Researched Selenium automation, Puppeteer browser control, and Twitter.js alternatives
- [ ] Research: GitHub API automation for repository management and GitHub Pages deployment

### Research Findings Summary
**Solana Meme Coin Viral Factors:**
- Community engagement metrics (social proof, holder distribution)
- Tokenomics design patterns (supply mechanics, bonding curves)
- Social media amplification loops (influencer coordination, meme formats)
- Cross-platform content strategies (X → Telegram → Discord funnel)
- Timing patterns (launch windows, market cycles)

**X Account Automation Methods:**
