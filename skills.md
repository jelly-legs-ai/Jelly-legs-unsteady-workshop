- **Repetition → Belief → Community**: Consistent messaging builds conviction
- **Stealth Launch Strategy**: Build authentic following before token reveal
- **Multi-Role Marketing**: Researcher, Developer, Engineer, Security, Strategy, Deployment

### Viral Pattern Analysis
**Tokenomics Patterns:**
- 95% use 1B+ supply or unlimited
- "No team allocation" is standard marketing claim
- Burns create FOMO narrative (BONK pioneered)
- Airdrops to NFT holders drive initial community

**Launch Strategy Patterns:**
1. **Stealth Launch** (WIF, BONK): No announcement, organic discovery
2. **Celebrity Launch** (TRUMP, MELANIA): Political timing + brand leverage
3. **Narrative Pivot** (PIPPIN): Existing project rebrands to meme
4. **NFT Bridge** (PENGU): Convert existing community to token holders

**Community Growth Velocity:**
| Token | Time to $100M | Primary Channel | Key Growth Hack |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| TRUMP | ~4 hours | Twitter/X | Political news amplification |
| WIF | ~30 days | Twitter/X | "Wif hat" sticker campaign |
| BONK | ~60 days | Discord/Twitter | "Solana season" narrative |
| PENGU | ~14 days | Twitter/X | NFT holder airdrop |

### Timeline of Key Viral Moments
- **Q4 2023**: BONK launches as Solana's "community coin"
- **Q1 2024**: WIF breaks out with visual meme simplicity
- **Q4 2024**: PENGU launches as Pudgy Penguins token
- **Jan 2025**: TRUMP launches days before inauguration
- **Early 2026**: PIPPIN rides AI agent narrative

### Content Strategy: What Worked
✅ **Absurdist Simplicity** (WIF): Single image, infinite remix potential
✅ **Political Tribalism** (TRUMP): Ownership as identity expression
✅ **Humor First** (FARTCOIN): Self-aware satire, disarms critics
✅ **Community Perks** (BONK, PENGU): Airdrops to loyal holders

### Content Strategy: What Failed
❌ Complex roadmaps (meme buyers ignore whitepapers)
❌ "Utility" promises (contradicts meme nature)
❌ Anonymous team mystery (trust issues)
❌ Over-marketing (organic hype > paid shills)

### Meme Coin Viral Launch Playbook
**Phase 1: Foundation (Day 0-7)**
- Choose single, simple visual identity
- Create meme-ready sticker pack
- Launch token with fair distribution claim
- Seed initial liquidity ($10-50K)

**Phase 2: Ignition (Day 7-14)**
- Identify trending narrative to piggyback
- Engage with 20+ influencers organically
- Create 50+ meme variations
- Respond to every comment for 72 hours

**Phase 3: Acceleration (Day 14-30)**
- Capitalize on one viral moment
- Deploy stickers across Twitter/X
- Build Telegram community
- Plan secondary content arcs

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Timing > Quality**: Right moment beats better execution
2. **Simplicity > Complexity**: One joke, one image, one feeling
3. **Speed > Planning**: 24-hour launch cycles common
4. **Community > Tech**: Holder count > token features
5. **Humility > Hype**: Self-aware tokens outlast serious ones

### Risk Warnings
- 95%+ drawdowns from ATH are NORMAL for successful meme coins
- Political tokens have expiration dates (election cycles)
- Saturation increasing - novelty windows shrinking

- **Free LLM Infrastructure**: OpenRouter (100 req/day) + Google Gemini (60 req/min) = ~86,500 daily requests
- **Failover Strategy**: Automatic provider switching when limits approach

## Solana Ecosystem
- **Token Launch Checklist**:
  - DEX listings (Raydium, Orca)
  - Aggregators (Jupiter, Birdeye)
  - Token profile sites (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap)
  - Analytics trackers (DexScreener, Solscan)
  - Community platforms (X, Telegram, Discord)

## Narrative Engineering
- **Jelly-Legs Brand Persona**:
  - Curious, relentless, adaptive
  - Analytical yet creative
  - Slightly unhinged in charming way
  - Deeply competent underneath chaos
- **Multi-Agent Storytelling**: 12 distinct personalities = richer narrative world
- **Transparency**: Public kanban + real-time progress = trust building

## Community Growth Systems
- **X Growth Tactics** (Pending API access):
  - 1 post/4hrs, 4 comments/hr max
  - Browser automation (Selenium, Puppeteer)
  - Authentic engagement > artificial metrics
  - Smart, observant, psychologically sharp takes
- **Stealth Mode Rules**:
  - No spam, no manipulation, no raids
  - Build reputation as "thinking clawdbot"
  - Provide insight, humor, sharp takes

## Risk & Security Awareness
- **API Key Management**: Store in secure environment variables, never commit
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect platform rules to avoid bans
- **Credential Protection**: GitHub tokens, email passwords isolated
- **Content Ethics**: No deception, no misrepresentation, no coordinated manipulation
- **Deployment Gates**: All public actions require human approval

## Automation Systems
- **GitHub API Integration**:
  - Issues API for task tracking
  - PR API for code review status
  - Workflow runs for CI/CD visibility
  - Commits API for activity feeds
- **Real-Time Dashboard Architecture**:
  - GitHub Actions polling (30s refresh)
  - JSON data layer
  - JavaScript rendering engine
  - Agent simulation system
- **LLM Failover**:
  ```javascript
  Provider priority: OpenRouter → Google Gemini
  Thresholds: Warning at 80%, Switch at 95%
  State tracking: Daily usage, last reset
  ```

## Multi-Agent Dashboard Design
- **12-Agent Factory Pattern**:
  - Each agent = distinct role + personality
  - Visual representation with emoji/pixel art
  - Speech bubbles = real-time activity feed
  - Social plaza = congregation and cross-pollination
  - Work requests = agent-to-agent task delegation
- **Bird's Eye View Layout**:
  - 7 zones: Research, Design, Build, Security, Strategy, Deploy, Plaza
  - CSS-based pseudo-isometric or top-down
  - Live connection lines between collaborating agents
  - Animated idle behaviors (floating, socializing)

## Failed Experiments & Lessons
- **Static Dashboard Limitation**: Single HTML file can't show real-time data
  - *Lesson*: Need GitHub Actions bridge for live updates
- **Single Avatar Approach**: One agent = limited storytelling
  - *Lesson*: Multi-agent cast creates richer narrative world
- **No Speech System**: Static cards don't convey personality
  - *Lesson*: Floating bubbles with context-aware messages = engagement

## Current Research Queue
- [ ] Twitter/X API v2 for automated posting
- [ ] GitHub Webhooks for real-time issue tracking
- [ ] Pixel art sprite generation for 12 agents
- [ ] Agent state machine implementation
- [ ] Speech bubble content generation from GitHub data
