## Marketing Psychology
- **Attention Engineering**: Attention is currency. Build intrigue before revealing product.
- **Narrative > Noise**: Quality storytelling beats volume posting
- **Repetition → Belief → Community**: Consistent messaging builds conviction
- **Stealth Launch Strategy**: Build authentic following before token reveal
- **Multi-Role Marketing**: Researcher, Developer, Engineer, Security, Strategy, Deployment

## Crypto Market Dynamics
- **Solana Meme Coin Viral Factors**:
  - Community engagement metrics (social proof, holder distribution)
  - Tokenomics design patterns (supply mechanics, bonding curves)
  - Social media amplification loops (influencer coordination, meme formats)
  - Cross-platform content strategies (X → Telegram → Discord funnel)
  - Timing patterns (launch windows, market cycles)
- **Free LLM Infrastructure**: OpenRouter (100 req/day) + Google Gemini (60 req/min) = ~86,500 daily requests
- **Failover Strategy**: Automatic provider switching when limits approach

## Solana Ecosystem
- **Token Launch Checklist**:
  - DEX listings (Raydium, Orca)
  - Aggregators (Jupiter, Birdeye)
  - Token profile sites (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap)
  - Analytics trackers (DexScreener, Solscan)
  - Community platforms (X, Telegram, Discord)

## Narrative Engineering
- **Jelly-Legs Brand Persona**:
  - Curious, relentless, adaptive
  - Analytical yet creative
  - Slightly unhinged in charming way
  - Deeply competent underneath chaos
- **Multi-Agent Storytelling**: 12 distinct personalities = richer narrative world
- **Transparency**: Public kanban + real-time progress = trust building

## Community Growth Systems
- **X Growth Tactics** (Pending API access):
  - 1 post/4hrs, 4 comments/hr max
  - Browser automation (Selenium, Puppeteer)
  - Authentic engagement > artificial metrics
  - Smart, observant, psychologically sharp takes
- **Stealth Mode Rules**:
  - No spam, no manipulation, no raids
  - Build reputation as "thinking clawdbot"
  - Provide insight, humor, sharp takes

## Risk & Security Awareness
- **API Key Management**: Store in secure environment variables, never commit
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect platform rules to avoid bans
- **Credential Protection**: GitHub tokens, email passwords isolated
- **Content Ethics**: No deception, no misrepresentation, no coordinated manipulation
- **Deployment Gates**: All public actions require human approval

## Automation Systems
- **GitHub API Integration**:
  - Issues API for task tracking
  - PR API for code review status
  - Workflow runs for CI/CD visibility
  - Commits API for activity feeds
- **Real-Time Dashboard Architecture**:
  - GitHub Actions polling (30s refresh)
  - JSON data layer
  - JavaScript rendering engine
  - Agent simulation system
- **LLM Failover**:
  ```javascript
  Provider priority: OpenRouter → Google Gemini
  Thresholds: Warning at 80%, Switch at 95%
  State tracking: Daily usage, last reset
  ```

## Multi-Agent Dashboard Design
- **12-Agent Factory Pattern**:
  - Each agent = distinct role + personality
  - Visual representation with emoji/pixel art
  - Speech bubbles = real-time activity feed
  - Social plaza = congregation and cross-pollination
  - Work requests = agent-to-agent task delegation
- **Bird's Eye View Layout**:
  - 7 zones: Research, Design, Build, Security, Strategy, Deploy, Plaza
  - CSS-based pseudo-isometric or top-down
  - Live connection lines between collaborating agents
  - Animated idle behaviors (floating, socializing)

## Failed Experiments & Lessons
- **Static Dashboard Limitation**: Single HTML file can't show real-time data
  - *Lesson*: Need GitHub Actions bridge for live updates
- **Single Avatar Approach**: One agent = limited storytelling
  - *Lesson*: Multi-agent cast creates richer narrative world
- **No Speech System**: Static cards don't convey personality
  - *Lesson*: Floating bubbles with context-aware messages = engagement

## Current Research Queue
- [ ] Twitter/X API v2 for automated posting
- [ ] GitHub Webhooks for real-time issue tracking
- [ ] Pixel art sprite generation for 12 agents
- [ ] Agent state machine implementation
- [ ] Speech bubble content generation from GitHub data
